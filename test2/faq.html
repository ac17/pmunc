											<p>If the students have purchased the hotel’s meal plan for Thursday, Friday and Saturday, they will only need money for breakfast and the meal(s) in Princeton on Friday. These meals would each cost between $6-$15. Students who do not purchase the hotel’s meal plan should estimate this same amount for every meal throughout the entire Conference. In addition, PMUNC t-shirts and travel mugs will be on sale at the conference for $10-$15 each and students will be able to buy Princeton gear from the University store during the campus visit on Friday. They can check their <a href="http://www.pustore.com">website</a> for selection and prices.
